    "Q1: Estimation Statistics involves the process of using sample data to estimate or infer characteristics of a population. There are two main types of estimation:\n",

    "- Point Estimate: A single value used to estimate a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is often used as a point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "- Interval Estimate: A range of values within which the population parameter is estimated to lie, along with a level of confidence. For example, a confidence interval for the population mean provides a range of values within which the true population mean is likely to fall.\n",
