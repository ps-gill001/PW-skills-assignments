    "A DataFrame in Pandas is a two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. It is the primary data structure in Pandas and is used for storing and manipulating tabular data. A DataFrame consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a column in a DataFrame. A Series can be thought of as a single column of a DataFrame, with a unique index associated with each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between a DataFrame and a Series:\n",

    "In this example, we first create a DataFrame `df` with three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City'. Each column has a different data type, and the DataFrame has four rows.\n",

    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods that can be used to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`head()`** and **`tail()`**: These functions allow you to view the first or last few rows of a DataFrame, respectively. This is useful for quickly inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`describe()`**: This function generates descriptive statistics for the numeric columns in a DataFrame, such as the count, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`dropna()`**: This function removes rows or columns with missing values (NaN) from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`fillna()`**: This function replaces missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a computed value (e.g., the mean or median).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`groupby()`**: This function allows you to group the DataFrame by one or more columns and perform aggregations, such as sum, mean, or count, on the grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`sort_values()`**: This function sorts the DataFrame by one or more columns in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`apply()`**: This function applies a function (either a built-in function or a custom function) to each element or group of elements in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`merge()`** and **`concat()`**: These functions allow you to combine multiple DataFrames based on common columns or indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using the `groupby()` function to calculate the average age for each city in the DataFrame we created earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob', 'Alice'],\n",
    "    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],\n",
    "    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo']\n",
    "}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grouping the DataFrame by 'City' and calculating the average age\n",
    "avg_age_by_city = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()\n",

    "City\n",
    "London     30.0\n",
    "New York   25.0\n",
    "Paris      35.0\n",
    "Tokyo      40.0\n",
    "Name: Age, dtype: float64\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the `groupby()` function to group the DataFrame by the 'City' column, and then we calculate the mean of the 'Age' column for each group using the `mean()` function. This allows us to quickly see the average age for each city in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `groupby()` function is a powerful tool for aggregating and summarizing data in a DataFrame. It can be used in a wide range of data analysis and reporting tasks, such as calculating sales figures by region, finding the top-selling products by category, or identifying the most active users in a social network"
