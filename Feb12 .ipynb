    "what is an exception in python? write difference between exception and syntax error\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle errors and unexpected situations that may arise during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and the program jumps to a special block of code called an exception handler, which can then take appropriate action to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between an exception and a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax Error**:\n",
    "   - A syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not follow the language's syntax rules.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase, before the program is executed.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from running, as the interpreter cannot understand the code.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, or using invalid syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception**:\n",
    "   - An exception occurs during the execution of a program, when the program encounters a situation it cannot handle.\n",
    "   - Exceptions are raised when a runtime error occurs, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an index out of range, or opening a file that does not exist.\n",
    "   - Exceptions do not prevent the program from running, but they interrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover from the error and continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a syntax error is a problem with the structure or grammar of the code, while an exception is a problem that occurs during the execution of the program. Syntax errors prevent the program from running, while exceptions can be handled and the program can continue executing."

    "what happens when an exception is not handled? explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    " When an exception is not handled, it can lead to the termination of the program and the display of an error message. This is known as an \"unhandled exception.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a program that tries to divide a number by zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "result = x / y\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when the program tries to divide `x` by `y`, which is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised. If this exception is not handled, the program will terminate, and you will see an error message similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 3, in <module>\n",
    "    result = x / y\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message provides information about the type of exception that occurred (`ZeroDivisionError`) and the location in the code where the exception was raised (line 3 of the `example.py` file).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exception is not handled, the program will stop executing, and any remaining code in the program will not be executed. This can be problematic if the program is performing important tasks or has critical sections of code that need to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, it is recommended to use try-except blocks to handle exceptions. This allows the program to catch and handle the exception, preventing the program from terminating and allowing it to continue executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 0\n",
    "    result = x / y\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the code that might raise an exception (the division operation) is placed inside a `try` block. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, the code in the `except` block is executed, and the program can handle the exception gracefully without terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "By handling exceptions, you can ensure that your program can continue to run even when unexpected situations arise, making it more robust and reliable."

    "3 which python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try-except` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. These statements allow you to detect and handle errors that may occur during the execution of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general syntax for the `try-except` statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except ExceptionType1:\n",
    "    # handle ExceptionType1\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except ExceptionType2:\n",
    "    # handle ExceptionType2\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except (ExceptionType3, ExceptionType4):\n",
    "    # handle ExceptionType3 and ExceptionType4\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    # handle any other exception\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to understand how the `try-except` statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    print(\"An unexpected error occurred.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. The `except` blocks are used to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the user enters a non-numeric value, a `ValueError` exception is raised, and the code in the first `except` block is executed, printing the message \"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the user enters the number 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised, and the code in the second `except` block is executed, printing the message \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If any other type of exception occurs, the code in the third `except` block is executed, printing the message \"An unexpected error occurred.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` statement allows you to anticipate and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your program, making your code more robust and resilient to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `finally` clause to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This is often used to perform cleanup operations, such as closing a file or releasing system resources"

    "a. `try` and `else`:\n",
    "The `else` clause in a `try-except` statement is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. This is useful when you want to perform some additional actions or computations after the potentially problematic code has executed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block (i.e., the user does not enter 0 for the second number), the code in the `else` block will be executed, and the result will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. `finally`:\n",
    "The `finally` clause in a `try-except` statement is used to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This is useful for performing cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing system resources, that need to be executed regardless of the outcome of the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",

    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    print(\"File closed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, even if an exception is raised in the `try` block (e.g., if the file does not exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "c. `raise`:\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to manually raise an exception. This is useful when you want to signal that a certain condition has occurred or when you want to create your own custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",

    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide()` function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception if the second argument is 0. The `try-except` block catches and handles the exception, printing the error message"

    "5.  what are custom exception in python? why do we need them? explain with example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that you can create to handle specific error conditions in your code. They are useful when the built-in exceptions provided by Python do not adequately describe the errors that can occur in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need custom exceptions?\n",
    "We need custom exceptions for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Error Handling**: Custom exceptions allow you to create more meaningful and descriptive error messages that are tailored to your application's specific needs. This can make it easier to identify and debug issues in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity and Maintainability**: By defining custom exceptions, you can encapsulate error handling logic within specific modules or components of your application. This can improve the overall modularity and maintainability of your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency and Clarity**: Custom exceptions can help establish a consistent error-handling strategy across your application, making the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are building a e-commerce application, and you want to handle cases where a customer tries to purchase an item that is out of stock. You can create a custom exception called `OutOfStockError` to handle this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class OutOfStockError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Raised when an item is out of stock.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class InventoryManager:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.inventory = {\"Product A\": 10, \"Product B\": 5, \"Product C\": 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "    def purchase_item(self, item_name, quantity):\n",
    "        if self.inventory[item_name] < quantity:\n",
    "            raise OutOfStockError(f\"{item_name} is out of stock.\")\n",
    "        self.inventory[item_name] -= quantity\n",
    "        print(f\"Purchased {quantity} of {item_name}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    inventory_manager = InventoryManager()\n",
    "    inventory_manager.purchase_item(\"Product C\", 2)\n",
    "except OutOfStockError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `OutOfStockError` is a custom exception that is raised when the requested quantity of an item exceeds the available stock. The `InventoryManager` class uses this custom exception to handle the out-of-stock scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a custom exception, you can provide a more meaningful error message and make it easier to identify and handle the specific error condition in your application.\n",
    "\n",
