    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management of the data. It serves as a central repository for storing and managing information that can be accessed and manipulated by users or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, scalability, and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Databases**:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "   - They use SQL as the standard query language for interacting with the database.\n",
    "   - SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and strict data integrity.\n",
    "   - Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "   - SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning they can be scaled by increasing the power of the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NoSQL Databases**:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "   - They do not require a fixed schema and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs for data retrieval and manipulation, depending on the database type.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are well-suited for applications that require horizontal scalability, high availability, and fast access to large volumes of data.\n",
    "   - Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, etc.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning they can be scaled by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are relational databases that use SQL for querying and are suitable for applications with complex relationships and transactions. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that offer flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages for applications with large volumes of unstructured data or distributed systems. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application being developed"

    " Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example\n",
    "    \n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure of a database and its objects. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common DDL commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**: The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas. It specifies the structure of the object, including column names, data types, constraints, and other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a new table named `employees` with columns for `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` in a MySQL database:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**: The `DROP` command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas. It removes the object and its data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the `employees` table from the MySQL database:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**: The `ALTER` command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects. It can be used to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or indexes from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column named `phone_number` to the `employees` table in the MySQL database:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**: The `TRUNCATE` command is used to remove all rows from a table, but it does not delete the table structure. It is faster than the `DELETE` command as it does not log individual row deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the `employees` table in the MySQL database:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands such as `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, and `TRUNCATE` are essential for defining the structure of a database and managing its objects. They allow database administrators and developers to create, modify, and delete database objects to meet the requirements of their applications"

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data stored in a database. DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common DML commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT**: The `INSERT` command is used to add new rows of data into a table. It specifies the table name and the values to be inserted into the columns of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new record into the `employees` table in a MySQL database:\n",

    "   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE**: The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing data in a table. It specifies the table name, the columns to be updated, and the new values for those columns. It also includes a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Updating the email address of an employee with `employee_id` 1 in the `employees` table in a MySQL database:\n",

    "   WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE**: The `DELETE` command is used to remove rows of data from a table. It specifies the table name and includes a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be deleted. If the `WHERE` clause is omitted, all rows in the table will be deleted.\n",

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are primarily focused on querying and selecting data from database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common DQL command is `SELECT`, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. The `SELECT` statement allows you to specify the columns to be retrieved, the table from which to retrieve the data, and optional conditions to filter the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of using the `SELECT` command to retrieve data from a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Retrieving all columns from the `employees` table in a MySQL database:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",

    "- `SELECT` is the keyword used to retrieve data.\n",
    "- `*` is a wildcard character that represents all columns in the table.\n",
    "- `FROM employees` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify specific columns to retrieve and add conditions to filter the data. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Retrieving only the `first_name` and `last_name` columns from the `employees` table where the `department` is 'IT':\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, a Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts that establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key**:\n",
    "   - A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.\n",
    "   - It must have a unique value for each row and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "   - The Primary Key enforces entity integrity and ensures that each record in a table is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "   - Typically, the Primary Key is defined when creating a table and is often implemented using an auto-incrementing integer column.\n",
    "   - Example: In a table named `students`, the `student_id` column can be designated as the Primary Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign Key**:\n",
    "   - A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between two tables based on a relationship between the data in the columns.\n",
    "   - It creates a referential integrity constraint between the two tables, ensuring that the values in the Foreign Key column(s) in one table match the values in the Primary Key column(s) in another table.\n",
    "   - The Foreign Key column(s) in one table refer to the Primary Key column(s) in another table.\n",
    "   - Foreign Keys help maintain data consistency and enforce relationships between tables in a relational database.\n",
    "   - Example: In a table named `orders`, the `customer_id` column can be designated as a Foreign Key that references the `customer_id` column in the `customers` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Primary Key uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a Foreign Key establishes a relationship between tables by linking the values in one table to the values in another table. Together, Primary Keys and Foreign Keys help maintain data integrity and enforce relationships between tables in a relational database."
