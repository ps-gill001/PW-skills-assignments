    "What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with predefined schemas, MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, semi-structured documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data that don't fit well into the rigid structure of traditional relational databases. These databases typically offer a flexible schema, horizontal scalability, and high availability, making them well-suited for applications that require rapid development, flexible data models, and the ability to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unstructured Data**: MongoDB excels at handling unstructured data, such as user-generated content, sensor data, and social media data, which may not fit well into the rigid table structure of SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to add more servers to handle increased data and traffic loads. This makes it a good choice for applications that need to handle large and growing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexible Schema**: MongoDB's document-oriented data model allows for a flexible schema, which means that the structure of the data can change over time without the need to modify the entire database schema. This is particularly useful for agile development environments where the data requirements may evolve rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Availability**: MongoDB offers built-in replication and automatic failover, which helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance, making it a suitable choice for mission-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-time Analytics**: MongoDB's ability to handle large volumes of data and its support for aggregation and indexing make it a good choice for real-time analytics and reporting applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Geospatial Data**: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, which makes it a good choice for applications that involve location-based services or geographic information systems (GIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a flexible, document-oriented data model, horizontal scalability, and high availability. It is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured, the application requires rapid development and flexible data models, or the application needs to handle large volumes of data and real-time analytics."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers several features that make it a compelling choice for a wide range of applications. Here are the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document-Oriented Data Model**: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for a more natural representation of data compared to the rigid table structure of traditional relational databases. This document-oriented approach enables developers to work with data in a way that more closely matches the structure of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Schema**: MongoDB has a flexible schema, which means that the structure of the data can change over time without the need to modify the entire database schema. This makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements, especially in agile development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to add more servers to handle increased data and traffic loads. This makes it a good choice for applications that need to handle large and growing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Availability**: MongoDB offers built-in replication and automatic failover, which helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance, making it a suitable choice for mission-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Indexing and Aggregation**: MongoDB provides advanced indexing and aggregation capabilities, which enable efficient querying and real-time analytics on large datasets. This makes it a good choice for applications that require complex data processing and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Geospatial Data Support**: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, which makes it a good choice for applications that involve location-based services or geographic information systems (GIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Flexible Query Language**: MongoDB's query language, which is similar to JavaScript, allows developers to perform complex queries and data manipulations with relative ease, compared to the more rigid SQL syntax of traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Sharding**: MongoDB's sharding feature allows you to distribute data across multiple servers, which can improve performance and scalability for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **GridFS**: MongoDB's GridFS feature allows you to store and retrieve large files, such as images, videos, and documents, directly in the database, making it a good choice for content-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a versatile and powerful database solution, particularly for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data"

    "\n",
    "Certainly, the `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query the database and retrieve documents that match the specified criteria. Here's how you can use the `find()` method:\n",

    "- `projection`: This is an optional parameter that specifies the fields to include or exclude in the returned documents.\n",

    "   - This method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter.\n",

    "   - This method is useful when you need to delete a group of documents, such as when removing all the records for a specific category or deleting all the documents that were created before a certain date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`drop()`**:\n",
    "   - This method is used to delete an entire collection from the database.\n",
    "   - It removes the collection and all the documents it contains.\n",
    "   - This method is useful when you need to completely remove a collection, such as when you're done with a temporary collection or when you need to start fresh with a new data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are essential for maintaining and managing the data in your MongoDB database. They allow you to selectively remove documents or entire collections, which can be necessary for various reasons, such as:\n",

    "- Removing outdated or irrelevant data to free up storage space.\n",
    "- Deleting user accounts or other sensitive information when it's no longer needed.\n",
