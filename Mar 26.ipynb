    "\n",
    "- **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves predicting a dependent variable (Y) based on a single independent variable (X). The relationship is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",
    "  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Generate some data\n",
    "  np.random.seed(0)\n",
    "  X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)\n",

    "- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Involves predicting a dependent variable (Y) based on multiple independent variables (X1, X2, ..., Xn). It extends simple linear regression to handle more complex relationships.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Generate some data\n",
    "  np.random.seed(0)\n",
    "  X1 = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)\n",
    "  X2 = 3 * np.random.rand(100, 1)\n",
    "  X = np.concatenate((X1, X2), axis=1)\n",
    "  y = 3 + 4 * X1 + 5 * X2 + np.random.randn(100, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Fit the model\n",

    "**Q2. Assumptions of Linear Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linearity**: The relationship between dependent and independent variables is linear.\n",
    "- **Independence**: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
    "- **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "- **Normality**: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "- **No multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking Assumptions:**\n",
    "- **Residual Analysis**: Plot residuals against predicted values to check for linearity and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "- **Normality Tests**: Use Q-Q plots or statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk to check normality.\n",
    "- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Calculate VIF for each independent variable to detect multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Interpretation of Slope and Intercept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept (β0)**: Represents the predicted value of Y when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "- **Slope (β1)**: Represents the change in Y for a unit change in X, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- In a real-world scenario, if we're predicting house prices (Y) based on square footage (X), the intercept would represent the baseline price of a house with zero square footage, and the slope would represent the increase in price for each additional square foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function (error) in machine learning models.\n",
    "- **Usage**: It iteratively adjusts model parameters (coefficients) to minimize the error between predicted and actual values by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Multiple Linear Regression Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Extends simple linear regression to multiple independent variables.\n",
    "- **Difference**: Allows modeling of complex relationships involving multiple predictors, unlike simple linear regression which uses only one predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Multicollinearity in Multiple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "- **Detection**: Calculate VIF for each variable; VIF > 10 indicates high multicollinearity.\n",
    "- **Addressing**: Remove one of the correlated variables, use principal component analysis (PCA), or combine variables to reduce collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Polynomial Regression Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Represents the relationship between dependent and independent variables as an nth degree polynomial.\n",
    "- **Difference**: Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship, polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Can fit complex curves, more flexible than linear regression.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Prone to overfitting with higher-degree polynomials, difficult to interpret for higher orders.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Suitable when relationships are non-linear and simple linear regression does not fit well.\n",
    "\n",
