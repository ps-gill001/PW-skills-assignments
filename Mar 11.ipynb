    "\n",
    "T-test:\n",
    "- Used when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "- Assumes the sample is drawn from a normal distribution.\n",
    "- Appropriate for small sample sizes (n &lt; 30).\n",
    "Example scenario: Comparing the mean test scores of two groups of students when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",

    "Z-test:\n",
    "- Used when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "- Assumes the sample is drawn from a normal distribution.\n",

    "Q2: The difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests lies in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed test:\n",
    "- The alternative hypothesis specifies a direction (greater than or less than) for the difference.\n",
    "- The test is conducted in a single direction (left-tailed or right-tailed).\n",
    "Example: Testing if a new drug reduces blood pressure (alternative hypothesis: mean decrease &gt; 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-tailed test:\n",
    "- The alternative hypothesis does not specify a direction for the difference.\n",
    "- The test is conducted in both directions (left-tailed and right-tailed).\n",
    "Example: Testing if a new teaching method affects student test scores (alternative hypothesis: mean scores are different).\n",

    "\n",
    "Type 1 error (α):\n",

    "\n",
    "The significance level (α) is the probability of a Type 1 error, and the power of a test is 1 - β, which is the probability of detecting an effect if it exists.\n",

    "Q4: Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula that relates conditional probabilities. It is used to update the probability of an event occurring based on new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",

    "Example: A medical test has a 90% chance of giving a positive result for a disease when the person has the disease (P(positive|disease) = 0.9), and a 5% chance of giving a positive result when the person does not have the disease (P(positive|no disease) = 0.05). If 1% of the population has the disease (P(disease) = 0.01), what is the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result?\n",

    "Using Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "P(disease|positive) = (P(positive|disease) * P(disease)) / P(positive)\n",

    "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter, such as the mean or proportion, with a specified level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval for the population mean (μ) with a known population standard deviation (σ) and a sample size (n):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the desired level of confidence (e.g., 95%, 99%).\n",
    "2. Calculate the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level from the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "3. Calculate the margin of error as: z * (σ / √n)\n",
    "4. The confidence interval is calculated as: sample mean ± margin of error\n",

    "- Sample standard deviation = 5\n",
    "- Sample size = 100\n",
    "- Desired confidence level = 95%\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The z-score for a 95% confidence level is 1.96.\n",
    "Step 2: Margin of error = 1.96 * (5 / √100) = 0.98\n",
    "Step 3: The 95% confidence interval is: 50 ± 0.98, or [49.02, 50.98].\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean lies between 49.02 and 50.98.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: To use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge and new evidence, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the prior probabilities of the events.\n",
    "2. Identify the conditional probabilities of the new evidence given each event.\n",
    "3. Apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the event given the new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A medical test for a certain disease has a 90% chance of giving a positive result when the person has the disease (P(positive|disease) = 0.9) and a 5% chance of giving a positive result when the person does not have the disease (P(positive|no disease) = 0.05). If 1% of the population has the disease (P(disease) = 0.01), what is the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "P(disease|positive) = (P(positive|disease) * P(disease)) / P(positive)\n",

    "P(disease|positive) = (0.9 * 0.01) / 0.0595 = 0.1512 or 15.12%\n",

    "Q7: To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Sample mean = 50\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation = 5\n",
    "- Desired confidence level = 95%\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Determine the z-score for a 95% confidence level, which is 1.96.\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate the margin of error as: z * (σ / √n)\n",
    "Assuming the sample size is large (n ≥ 30), the margin of error is:\n",
    "1.96 * (5 / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: The 95% confidence interval is calculated as:\n",
    "Sample mean ± margin of error\n",
    "50 ± 1.96 * (5 / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the results:\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval suggests that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean lies within the calculated range. The width of the confidence interval depends on the sample size, with larger samples resulting in a narrower interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the sample size is 100, the margin of error would be 1.96 * (5 / √100) = 0.98, and the 95% confidence interval would be 50 ± 0.98, or [49.02, 50.98].\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean is between 49.02 and 50.98.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range of values around the sample statistic that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It is the value added and subtracted from the sample statistic to create the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the margin of error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of Error = z * (standard deviation / √sample size)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size affects the margin of error in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.\n",
    "- Larger sample sizes provide more precise estimates of the population parameter, resulting in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "A company wants to estimate the average monthly sales for their products. They take two samples:\n",
    "- Sample 1 (n = 50): Average monthly sales = $5,000, standard deviation = $1,000\n",
    "- Sample 2 (n = 100): Average monthly sales = $5,000, standard deviation = $1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval would be smaller for the larger sample (n = 100) compared to the smaller sample (n = 50), assuming the same standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. To calculate the z-score for a data point, we use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (data point - population mean) / population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Data point = 75\n",
    "- Population mean = 70\n",
    "- Population standard deviation = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (75 - 70) / 5 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The z-score of 1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the population mean. This means that the data point is in the upper 84.13% of the population, assuming a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the new weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level, we can use a one-sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis (H0): The drug is not effective, and the mean weight loss is 0.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis (H1): The drug is effective, and the mean weight loss is greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Sample size (n) = 50\n",
    "- Sample mean weight loss = 6 pounds\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation = 2.5 pounds\n",

    "Step 2: Determine the p-value:\n",
    "The p-value for a one-tailed t-test with 49 degrees of freedom (n-1) and a t-value of 16 is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Compare the p-value to the significance level:\n",
    "Since the p-value (0) is less than the significance level of 0.05 (95% confidence level), we can reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Conclusion: The results provide strong evidence that the new weight loss drug is significantly effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "p̂ ± z * √(p̂ * (1 - p̂) / n)\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- p̂ is the sample proportion (0.65 in this case)\n",
