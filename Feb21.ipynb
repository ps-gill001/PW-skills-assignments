    "### Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give Three Areas Where Web Scraping is Used to Get Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Scraping**:\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the web pages and extracting the necessary information from the HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it Used**:\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: To gather large amounts of data from websites for analysis, research, or aggregation.\n",
    "- **Market Research**: To monitor competitors, track pricing, and gather market insights.\n",
    "- **Content Aggregation**: To compile information from multiple sources into a single repository or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas Where Web Scraping is Used**:\n",
    "1. **E-commerce**: To track product prices, availability, and reviews from various online stores.\n",
    "2. **Real Estate**: To collect data on property listings, prices, and trends from real estate websites.\n",
    "3. **Social Media**: To gather insights from social media platforms, such as user sentiment, trending topics, and engagement metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are the Different Methods Used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Methods Used for Web Scraping**:\n",
    "1. **Manual Scraping**: Copying and pasting data manually from web pages.\n",
    "2. **Automated Tools**:\n",
    "   - **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.\n",
    "   - **Scrapy**: An open-source web crawling framework for Python.\n",
    "   - **Selenium**: A tool for automating web browsers, useful for scraping dynamic content.\n",
    "   - **Requests**: A Python library for sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.\n",
    "3. **APIs**: Some websites provide APIs to access their data programmatically.\n",
    "4. **Headless Browsers**: Browsers like Puppeteer or PhantomJS that can be controlled programmatically to scrape web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beautiful Soup**:\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it Used**:\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the process of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n",
    "- **Versatility**: Works with different parsers like lxml and html.parser, making it flexible for various web scraping needs.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Handles poorly formatted HTML and XML documents gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Why is Flask Used in This Web Scraping Project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is used in a web scraping project for several reasons:\n",
    "- **Simple and Lightweight**: Flask is a micro web framework that is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications.\n",
    "- **Routing**: Flask provides easy URL routing, which is useful for creating endpoints to trigger scraping functions and display results.\n",
    "- **Integration**: It can easily integrate with web scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Flask allows for the development of both the scraping logic and the web interface within the same application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Names of AWS Services Used in This Project and Their Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "**AWS Services Used**:\n",
    "1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Provides scalable virtual servers to run web scraping scripts and host the Flask application.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Stores the scraped data, backups, and any other files generated by the web scraping project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Manages relational databases in the cloud, used for storing structured data collected from web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **AWS Lambda**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Executes code in response to events such as HTTP requests, useful for running scraping scripts on demand without managing servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Amazon CloudWatch**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Monitors and logs the performance of the web scraping scripts and the Flask application, helping in debugging and optimizing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these AWS services ensures that the web scraping project is scalable, reliable, and easy to manage, with robust storage and monitoring capabilities."
