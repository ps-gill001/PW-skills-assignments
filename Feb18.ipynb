    "### Q1. What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)**: An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- **Google Maps API**: Used by many websites and apps to embed maps and provide geographical information. For instance, a travel booking site might use the Google Maps API to show the location of hotels and nearby attractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "1. **Integration**: Facilitates communication and data exchange between different software systems.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: Allows reuse of functionality without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "3. **Automation**: Enables automation of tasks and processes.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Supports the development of scalable applications by enabling modularity.\n",
    "5. **Innovation**: Encourages innovation by allowing developers to build on existing services and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. **Security**: APIs can expose sensitive data and operations, making them a target for attacks if not properly secured.\n",
    "2. **Dependency**: Applications relying on third-party APIs can be affected by changes or downtimes of those APIs.\n",
    "3. **Complexity**: Managing and integrating multiple APIs can be complex.\n",
    "4. **Maintenance**: Requires ongoing maintenance to handle updates and changes in the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web API**: A Web API is a specific type of API that uses HTTP requests to interact with web services. Web APIs are designed to be accessed over the web by clients (such as web browsers or mobile apps) using standard web protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences**:\n",
    "- **API**: A general term for any interface that allows software components to communicate. It can be local (within the same machine) or remote (across different machines).\n",
    "- **Web API**: Specifically refers to APIs that are accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. REST and SOAP Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (Representational State Transfer)**:\n",
    "- An architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "- Resources are identified by URIs, and operations are stateless.\n",
    "- Typically exchanges data in JSON or XML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:\n",
    "- A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "- Uses XML for message format and relies on application layer protocols like HTTP or SMTP.\n",
    "- Includes built-in error handling and security features like WS-Security.\n",
    "- More rigid and requires a strict contract (WSDL) between client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of SOAP**:\n",
    "- Complexity: SOAP messages are more complex and larger due to XML formatting.\n",
    "- Performance: Slower due to verbosity and additional processing.\n",
    "- Rigid Structure: Requires strict adherence to WSDL contracts, making it less flexible.\n",
    "- Higher Overhead: Additional overhead due to envelope, headers, and parsing of XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Differences Between REST and SOAP\n",
