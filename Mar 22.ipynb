    "### Q1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Study Time and Exam Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data:\n",
    "- Study time (hours): [3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "- Exam scores: [80, 85, 60, 90, 75, 70, 95, 85, 80, 77]\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate Pearson correlation coefficient using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "study_time = np.array([3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 4])\n",
    "exam_scores = np.array([80, 85, 60, 90, 75, 70, 95, 85, 80, 77])\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Pearson correlation coefficient: {pearson_corr:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: \n",
    "- Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: A positive value close to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study time and exam scores, meaning as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase.\n",

    "### Q2. Spearman's Rank Correlation for Sleep and Job Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data:\n",
    "- Hours of sleep: [7, 6, 8, 5, 7, 6, 9, 5, 8, 6]\n",
    "- Job satisfaction (scale of 1-10): [8, 7, 9, 5, 8, 6, 9, 4, 7, 6]\n",

    "To calculate Spearman's rank correlation using Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: {spearman_corr:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- Spearman's rank correlation coefficient also ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: A positive value close to 1 indicates a strong monotonic relationship between hours of sleep and job satisfaction, meaning as hours of sleep increase, job satisfaction tends to increase.\n",

    "### Q3. Pearson vs Spearman Correlation for Exercise Hours and BMI\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data:\n",
    "- Exercise hours per week: [3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison**:\n",
    "- **Pearson vs Spearman**: Pearson assumes a linear relationship, while Spearman assesses monotonic relationships (any increasing or decreasing relationship).\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: If Pearson correlation is significantly different from Spearman's, it suggests the relationship is non-linear.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: A negative correlation close to -1 suggests that as TV watching hours increase, physical activity tends to decrease.\n",

    "### Q6. Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Sales Calls and Sales Made\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data:\n",
    "- Sales calls per day: [10, 8, 12, 9, 11, 7, 13, 9, 10, 8]\n",
