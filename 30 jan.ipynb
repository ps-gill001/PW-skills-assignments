    "#5.why and when to use while loop in python give a detailed description with example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It is particularly useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed description of why and when to use a `while` loop in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When the number of iterations is unknown**: If you are unsure about the number of times you need to iterate over a block of code, a `while` loop is a good choice. You can continue executing the loop until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic conditions**: `while` loops are suitable when the condition for loop termination is dynamic and may change during the execution of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterating over sequences**: While `for` loops are commonly used for iterating over sequences like lists, tuples, or strings, `while` loops are more appropriate when the iteration depends on a condition other than the sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    " Let's consider an example where we want to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 1\n",
    "   while num <= 5:\n",
    "       print(num)\n",
    "       num += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the loop continues to execute as long as the `num` variable is less than or equal to 5. The `num += 1` statement increments the value of `num` in each iteration. Once `num` becomes 6, the condition `num <= 5` becomes false, and the loop terminates.\n"
